# Library Application
## Before you build and try the application you must:

 - Install the font [password.ttf](https://github.com/alexandrubunea/library-wpf-application/blob/master/Library%20Application/Resources/password.ttf)
 - Import the database from the [database script](https://github.com/alexandrubunea/library-wpf-application/blob/master/database.sql).
 - Make sure that your [connection string](https://github.com/alexandrubunea/library-wpf-application/blob/master/Library%20Application/App.config) is correct.
 ## How to get access to library manager
 1. Create an account in the application.
 2. Open your database manager and set your account's access level to a value that is higher than one.
 3. Now you will have access to the library manager, this is the only way to get access to it.
 ## This can be improved
 Feel free to fork this project and try to improve it, there are many things that I probably missed out and can be improved, or just add your own ideas to it.
